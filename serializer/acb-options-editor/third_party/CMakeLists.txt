# Third-party libraries

# QHexView can be added as a submodule:
# git submodule add https://github.com/Dax89/QHexView.git third_party/qhexview

# For now, use placeholder - the hex view is implemented in QML
# if(EXISTS "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/qhexview/CMakeLists.txt")
#     add_subdirectory(qhexview)
# endif()
